Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health related states and use of that knowledge to improve population health. Global warming is a key force that has significant impacts on population health. The aim of this chapter is to provide an outline of key epidemiological approaches that are used to study health impacts of climate change. We begin with a brief description of the key issues associated with climate change (increase in the ambient temperature due to global warming, increased and abnormal patterns of rainfall and humidity, glacial melting and rise in the sea levels, and increased frequency of storms and adverse weather events due to possible alterations in the oceanic currents and forces). Climate change brings epidemiological r</div>
