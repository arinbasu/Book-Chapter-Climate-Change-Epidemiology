In case of variables and indicators of climate change, this could be for instance a variable that is associated both with the measured attribute of climate change and any outcome variable that is under investigation. For instance, in the study of urban heat island and temperature rise and deaths from heart disease, one would include use of motor vehicles for transport and inactivity or sedentary lifestyle as a confounding variable. A confounding variable is one that is associated or linked to both the exposure and outcome variables but one that does not come in the causal pathway. In the above example, use of cars and inactivity is a confounding variable in the association between temperature and heart disease as use of cars for transport and inactive lifestyle is a known risk factor for heart disease (??citations) and inactive and use of vehicles is associated with rising temperature rather the other way around (see Figure xxx) // insert a figure illustrating the association between an exposure variable, an outcome and a confounding variable In 1965, in his famous address to the British Occupational Scociety meeting, Professor Sir Austin Bradford Hill (1965) outlined nine considerations that stand tst he described as considerations for c a cause and effect assocaition. Many issues These are strength of association between an exposure and outcome measured with relative risk estimates but also with the prevalence of the risk facor factors, consistency of the findings betwen the risk factor and the outcome, specificity of association between the exposure and the outcome, that the exposure must precede the outcome in time, and other factors <span>(Hill, AB 1965)</span>. As majority of the studies about climate change and helth health is ecological and not individual study based, threfore many of th the considerations that Hill talked about in his lecture cannot be directly applid applied to climate change rlated related studies. Nevertheless, these considerations provide important pointers to th the study of climate change variables and studies on health effects. Table XXX. A list of considerations for association and causation</div><div></div><div>Epidemiological study designs that are cohort studies or case control studies depend on collecting data from individuals and local variations in the pattern of exposure. Thus, in cohort studies, scientists would classify individuals into exposed and non-exposed groups and would follow them through over time to study emergence of disease conditions or health states that were absent in the beginning of the study. In case control studies, scientists would consider people with and without diseases and would then use data collection to ascertain likelihood of exposure. While these study designs provide insights into individual exposure and outcomes, these study designs are of limited use when it comes to study parameters of climate change, because the variations are in planetary scales or in scales over hundreds and thousands of years. On the other thand, study designs such as ecological study designs where aggregated measuresments are used for comparing exposures and outcomes are preferred to study time dependent or space dependent changes in both exposures and outcomes and such study designs with large scale data ("big data") are also suited to study planetary scale variability. However, while these studies based on aggregated data are useful for studying associations between climate change parameters, they are also not applicable to individual situations. In other words, knowing temperature changes are associated increase mortality or hospitalisations would not enable us to deduce that on a particular hot day or weather conditions would also predict an individual with a higher risk of death or hospitalisation. Such inference is referred to as ecological fallacy and indicates that it is impossible to extrapolate results of ecological studies to individual cases <span>(WHO 2001)</span>. While it is impossible to infer individual causal risk associations from aggregated measurements and therefore from the results of epidemiological studies, scientists have studied the health effects of climate change in other ways. We will provide here examples of how epidemic investigation, and use of metrics where vulnerability of individuals as variation of responses to climate changes can be used to study health effects of climate change. One approach towards attributing climate change as a contributor to health effects is to use epidemiological methods to study health effects and specific environmental exposure that are attributed to climate change. For example, Martinez-Urtaza (2010) conducted a review of the outbreaks of the vibrio parahaemolyticus and vibrio vulnificus in different parts of the world and suggest that data from satellite imagery have provided oceanographic data of the spread of the warmer ocean water to temperate and closer to the poles and El Nino phenomena have contributed to the emergence of virulent strains of vibrio parahaemolyticus and vibrio vulnificus and new epidemics and endemic regions have appeared in regions of the world that were not known previously <span>(Martinez-Urtaza et al. 2010)</span>. This approach provides an indirect connection to the causal linkage between climate change and specific disease or disease outbreaks. In an investigation of gastroenteritis outbreak in a cruise ship in Alaska in 2004, McLaughlin et.al. (2005) conducted a retrospective cohort study of the passengers in the cruise ship where the gastroenteritis outbreak occured and found that consumption of raw oysters was predictor of illness. The investigators suggested that the rising temperature of the ocean water contributed to this outbreak <span>(McLaughlin et al. 2005)</span>. While the investigators conducted a retrospective cohort study to ascertain the cause of the illness in the cruise-ship passengers, the real cause could be traced back to the phenomenon of global warming and climate change as this investigation would reveal that the northernmost documented source of the oysters spread by about 1000 kilometers and this unusual phenomenon might be explained by an unusual warm ocean water.</div><div>According to AR5 report of the IPCC, there are three mechanisms by which cilmate change will exert effects on health: direct impacts of climate change, indirect impacts, and human factor mediated changes. Direct impacts include increased temperature, increased risks of drought and flood, heavy rainfall in places, increased risk of hurricanes and storms; &nbsp;indirect effects include increase in vector species such as mosquitoes, crop failure, and other effects that will result in response to climate related changes; and societal changes, for example, conflicts, migration of people from one region to another&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Smith:2011wj}</cite>. &nbsp;Epidemiological studies have addressed each of these factors on the association with specified health outcomes.&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="679239" class="ltx_title_subsection">Summary</h2><div></div><h1>References</h1><div><div>Allwood, J M, V Bosetti, N K Dubash, L Gomez-Echeverri, and C von Stechow. 2014. “Glossary.” In <i>Climate Change 2014:</i> edited by O Edenhofer, R Pichs-Madruga, Y Sokona, E Farahani, K Kadner, and J C Minx, 1–34.
