<div>Abstract</div><div></div><div>In this chapter, we describe the epidemiological study designs that are used to analyse health effects due to climate change. Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health related states and use of that knowledge We begin with a brief description of the key issues associated with climate change (increase in the ambient temperature due to global warming, increased and abnormal patterns of rainfall and humidity, glacial melting and rise in the sea levels, and increased frequency of storms and adverse weather events due to possible alterations in the oceanic currents and forces). We outline the range of health effects studied using epidemiological approaches.&nbsp;</div>
