<h1>Introduction</h1><div>The goal of this chapter is to present the key principles of Epidemiology that can be used to interpret, describe, and analyse the health effects of climate change. Epidemiology refers to the study of the distribution and determinants of health related states and use of this knowledge to bring about improvements in health states of populations&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Porta:2014vy}</cite>. Since the inception of the industrial era in the nineteenth century, a continual and progressive increase in the emission of greenhouse gases and their accumulation in the atmosphere have led to a corresponding rise in Earth's temperature. This phenomenon is referred to as "Global Warming". In turn, global warming has led to an alteration in the Earth's climate&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{CampbellLendrum:2007cg}</cite></div><div>Climate change is manifested in changing patterns of weather, world-wide melting of polar ice caps, loss of sea-ice, retreat of glaciers, and changing patterns of rainfall and humidity. These cascades of events are interconnected and have led to rise in sea levels, flooding of coastal areas, changes in the wind patterns, increased frequency of storm surges and hurricanes, loss of coral reefs, altered ocean salinity, abnormal rainfall patterns, with loss and migration of marine flora and fauna <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{xun2010climate}</cite>.</div><div>These phenomena have affected health of populations in different ways. Increased temperature and humidity due to global warming have resulted in worldwide changes in frequency of heat stress-related disorders, and worldwide increased incidence of microbial and parasitic infections. Altered weather, rainfall, changes in ocean salinity and migration of marine flora and fauna, loss of natural habitats, and natural disasters result in crop failures and resulted in mass malnutrition; flooding of coastal areas lead to shifting human habitats, mass migration of affected populations and force them to relocate. In turn, these lead to new patterns of population health effects ranging from emergent patterns of microbial and parasitic diseases, nutritional and behavioural disorders, conflicts, and resultant loss of social well-being for populations. In summary, heat-related diseases, infectious and microbial diseases, nutritional disorders, social conflicts, diseases attributed to poverty and stress are hallmarks of Climate Change as an exposure variable.</div><div>Epidemiology is a body of knowledge of the study of the distribution and determinants of various health related states in populations. Beyond studying physical, mental, and social well-being related states, Epidemiological principles are used to predict future health states of populations, and design interventions to enhance population based physical, mental, and social health and well-being. Depending on the contexts and exposures, Epidemiology has been classified into various branches. These include clinical epidemiology (epidemiology as applied for studying clinical conditions and individual patient care), environmental epidemiology (epidemiological principles used to study health effects of environmental exposures), and social epidemiology (health effects of social phenomena). Hence the range is broad in the scope of investigation and use of Epidemiology to study health effects due to climate change. While it is reasonable that Climate Change is largely environmental, in applying principles of Epidemiology to analyse and interpret health effects of climate change, the disciplinary boundaries are blurred. As changing climate affects populations in different aspects (physical health, behavioural disorders, and social conditions such as mass migration, and conflicts), in using epidemiological principles to study health effects due to climate change, all these aspects need to be taken into consideration. As a result, in discussing Epidemiology in relation to climate change, in the first place, we need to include a broad overarching view of Epidemiology.</div><div>We have thus organised this chapter as follows. We set out with a brief discussion of the key principles of Epidemiology with special references to existing Epidemiological studies to the health effects due to climate change, largely to set the scene. Then we describe key known issues associated with climate change as exposure. These include greenhouse gas emissions-induced increase in ambient temperature, increased and abnormal patterns of rainfall and humidity, glacial melting and rise in the sea levels with coastal flooding, and&nbsp;increased frequency of natural disasters - storms and adverse weather events due to possible alterations in the oceanic currents and forces. In this sense, the phenomenon of climate change brings environmental epidemiological research at the crossroads of studying health effects of heat exposure, temperature extremes, natural disasters, emergent infectious diseases, health effects due to migration, and health effects of increased human-animal interactions. With this in perspective, &nbsp;we next provide a brief overview of key principles of epidemiological study designs to describe and identify determinants to study these phenomena (principles of disease surveillance, longitudinal studies, retrospective and prospective cohort studies, case control studies, and case crossover studies). In the third &amp; final section, we describe the challenges and approaches of different epidemiological study designs and approaches for each of these different situations and sketch out a conceptual map of the next steps in using epidemiological studies to address health issues associated with global warming.</div><h1>Overview of Epidemiological Study designs</h1><div>"Epidemiology" (<i>Epi</i> = upon,&nbsp;<i>demo</i> = people, and&nbsp;<i>logos</i> = study), suggests that it should be the study of every phenomena that affects populations. More formally, the definition of Epidemiology as mentioned in the Dictionary of Epidemiology is stated as follows:</div><blockquote>The study of the occurrence and distribution of health-related events, and processes in specified populations, including the study of determinants influencing such processes, and the application of this knowledge to control relevant health problems. ... Epidemiology is much more than a branch of medicine treating of epidemics. Epidemiology may also study disease in populations of animals and plants&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Porta:2014vy}</cite></blockquote><div>This definition highlights three aspects of Epidemiology that are significant in studying climate related health events. The first component refers to the role of <b>descriptive epidemiology</b>, the branch of epidemiology  involved in studying of disease patterns in terms of their distribution in time and space (temporal and spatial distribution). Public health surveillance is an epidemiological activity where cases of diseases or health related states are observed, recorded, and analysed in terms of their distribution in termsof time and their spatial spread. These data are then used for planning health care planning. According to Campbell-Lendrum et.al. (2006) public health surveillance is essential in studying health effects of climate change for three related related reasons: (1) health effects such as infectious disease outbreaks attributable to climate shifts can be rapid and therefore it is important to keep accurate records, (2) climate change results in increased movement and contact between humans, pathogens and reservoirs, and (3) human and animal disease outbreak monitoring need to be integrated with environmental monitoring, indicating need for the emergence of an integrative concept of planetary health (more citations needed)<span>(Campbell-Lendrum, Corval√°n, and Neira 2007)</span>. The second aspect is that of the importance of&nbsp;<b>Analytical Epidemiology</b> -- the branch of epidemiology involved in investigating cause and effect associations between exposure and health outcomes -- in unravelling the cause and effect association between the downstream effects of climate changes characterised by increased temperature, humidity, pathogens, social situations brought about by adverse weather events and defined health states. McMichael (2006) has argued that some of the causal pathways that link the downstream effects of climate change (for example heat stress and deaths) are better represented or have become uncontentious in the literature over several decades, while others (for example more complex pathways that link climate change related social changes and changes in the social determinants of health) are more contentious and are less studied. Also, not all health effects are harmful: increased global warming will lead to milder winters in higher latitudes of Northern and Southern Hemispheres leading to much less deaths due to cold related conditions, and likewise, hotter and drier conditions in some of the subtropical regions in the world might lead to lower breeding of mosquitoes due to adverse climatic conditions&nbsp;<span>(McMichael, Woodruff, and Hales 2006)</span>. The third aspect of Epidemiology is its use in real world applications and policy making -- the field of&nbsp;<b>Applied Epidemiology</b> and in translational research -- where the knowledge obtained from surveillance systems and analytical study designs such as case control and cohort studies are then applied to set policy and public health decision making and programme planning. In climate change literature, such applications are in reducing vulnerability of communities to climate change either through adaptation or mitigation. The term "adaptation" refers to the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, and in humans, this process seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities; mitigation refers to the process of human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs) by any means&nbsp;<span>(Allwood et al. 2014)</span>. Analytical epidemiological studies can provide information about the predisposing features of what make communities vulnerable to the effects of climate change; equally, such studies can also provide effectiveness of interventions that will help communities to better adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change (citations needed)</div><h2>Key Measures and Epidemiological Study designs</h2><div>In epidemiological studies, epidemiologists begin with observation of health phenomena, then they set theories to explain the health phenomena, and based on the theory, they make predictions as to what may be observed if the conditions of the theories were to be true. Finally, they design studies to collect data and analyse the data to test the hypotheses. These theories lead them to develop specified hypotheses. They then collect data from the community or the environment of epidemiological investigations to test the hypotheses. Climate change belongs to environmental epidemiology -- the branch of epidemiology where we study environmental events as triggers or risk factors. In Environmental Epidemiology, Epidemiologists search for exposure of interest in the environment. They measure health outcomes in a number of different ways and use different metrics to describe these outcomes (Table 1). Prevalence is a measure of the probability of the occurrence of a disease, while incidence is a rate. Incidence of a disease refers to the extent of new cases occur among susceptible individuals over a specified period of time. The denominator in prevalence estimates is the total number of individuals, while the denominator in incidence factors in the total number of individuals and the follow up period of time over which the disease occurs. This is the concept of person-years. If 1000 individuals are followed up over one year, this would accrue 1000 person-years, and this figure would be equivalent of 100 individuals followed up over 10 years, or 200 individuals followed up over five years; indeed any combination of the number of persons and the time period over which these people would be followed to equate 1000 person-years would be admissible. Under steady state conditions, i.e., under those conditions, e.g., during infectious diseases, where the rate at which individuals contract a disease roughly equate the rate at which the individuals leave the disease state (i.e., they either recover or die), prevalence of the disease equates the product of incidence and duration of the disease. Prevalence and incidence are measures of descriptive epidemiology; relative risk estimates in the form of rate ratios, odds ratios, standardised mortality and morbidity ratios and hazard ratios are measures of analytical epidemiology. Epidemiologists use different risk measures for measure of association of an exposure with an outcome. Rate Ratio is a measure of association where we compare incidence rates of disease occurrence among those who are exposed and those who are unexposed. This is a measure of relative risk. Odds Ratio (OR) is a measure of the likelihood of exposure between those who have the disease (referred to as cases in the context of case control study) and those who do not have the disease (controls in the context of a case control study). Standardized mortality or morbidity ratios (SMR) refer to the ratio of the total number of individuals with a disease between two different populations. Using standardised mortality ratios or standardised morbidity ratios, Epidemiologists can compare the rate of occurrence of diseases across different geographical regions or across populations that have different age distributions. Researchers have used Standardized mortality ratios not only as measures of association between different geographical regions, but also across time points. Fernandez et.al. (2008) hypothesized that meteorological variables predicted the rise of asthma mortality in Cuba. To test their hypotheses, they correlated spatial meteorological data and standardised mortality ratios from Asthma in these regions between 1989-2003&nbsp;<span>(Fern√°ndez et al. 2008)</span>. Hazards Ratio (HR) refers to the ratio of competing likelihoods of health effects from an exposure over time. Wang et.al. (2013) tested the hypothesis that exposure to heatwave would lead to higher rates of preterm birth; they conducted a population based ecological study of 50, 848 spontaneous births in Brisbane between 2000-2010. They obtained daily data on pregnancy outcomes, meteorological factors and air pollutants between 1999-2010. For this birth cohort, they used survival analysis to study the effect of meteorological factors on pre-term births and reported hazards ratio for pre-term births for women who experienced heat waves as opposed to those who did not experience heat wave&nbsp;<span>(Wang et al. 2013)</span>. Thus, depending on different types of study designs, Environmental epidemiologists use different measures of association between exposures of interest and health outcomes. In particular, they use associative measures to indicate strengths of association for causal linkages.</div><h2>Cause and Effect in Environmental Epidemiology and Climate studies</h2><div>Although the first step in epidemiological investigations is to describe the health outcome and the phenomenon of exposure, the crux of epidemiological studies is in unravelling of a cause and effect association. This requires two steps in tandem: first, we need to establish that an observed association is valid; next, we need to examine the nature of that association as one of cause and effect. Table 1.

S. Porta 2014)</span>. Such systematic deviations could result from differences in how the participants are selected for studies (selection bias), or how the participants in the study were to provide information to the investigators/epidemiologists that in turn would affect the interpretation of the data or data analysis itself (response bias). Be that as it may, there are two ways such misclassification from the true distribution across the comparative arms can arise: in one case if the extent to which the misclassification were similar in both comparison groups, the bias would be non-differential and as such the effect estimate would be drawn closer to the null value than what it would otherwise be; in the other case, the deviation of the observed effect size would be uncertain in terms of the direction from the true value (differential misclassification bias). However, in case of epidemiological studies of health effects of climate change, as most of the studies are likely to be ecological studies or studies that would study aggregated measurements of the climate parameters with respect to human health outcomes, biases that occur due to individual participant based studies are not applicable. Instead, in case of synthesis of literature (meta-analysis), we would discuss possibility of publication bias such that only large and studies of positive association get reported over studies that are small and have equivocal results. However, some authors have claimed that publication bias is not an issue with climate change and health related studies (??add the citation here).</div><h1>Confounding Variables in Climate Change research</h1><div>In Epidemiology, when we study real association between an exposure and health effects, we need to be mindful about three alternative explanations that can explain that apparently the association could in fact really be due to either explained by chance alone, or by biases introduced during the design of the study or during data collection or analysis; the third explanation is that the exposure-disease association can be explained by a third variable that is independently associated both with the exposure and with the outcome variable. In case of variables and indicators of climate change, this could be for instance a variable that is associated both with the measured attribute of climate change and any outcome variable that is under investigation. For instance, in the study of urban heat island and temperature rise and deaths from heart disease, one would include use of motor vehicles for transport and inactivity or sedentary lifestyle as a confounding variable. A confounding variable is one that is associated or linked to both the exposure and outcome variables but one that does not come in the causal pathway. In the above example, use of cars and inactivity is a confounding variable in the association between temperature and heart disease as use of cars for transport and inactive lifestyle is a known risk factor for heart disease (??citations) and inactive and use of vehicles is associated with rising temperature rather the other way around (see Figure xxx) // insert a figure illustrating the association between an exposure variable, an outcome and a confounding variable In 1965, in his famous address to the British Occupational Scociety meeting, Professor Sir Austin Bradford Hill (1965) outlined nine considerations that stand tst he described as considerations for c a cause and effect assocaition. Many issues These are strength of association between an exposure and outcome measured with relative risk estimates but also with the prevalence of the risk facor factors, consistency of the findings betwen the risk factor and the outcome, specificity of association between the exposure and the outcome, that the exposure must precede the outcome in time, and other factors <span>(Hill, AB 1965)</span>. As majority of the studies about climate change and helth health is ecological and not individual study based, threfore many of th the considerations that Hill talked about in his lecture cannot be directly applid applied to climate change rlated related studies. Nevertheless, these considerations provide important pointers to th the study of climate change variables and studies on health effects. Table XXX. A list of considerations for association and causation</div><div></div><div>Epidemiological study designs that are cohort studies or case control studies depend on collecting data from individuals and local variations in the pattern of exposure. Thus, in cohort studies, scientists would classify individuals into exposed and non-exposed groups and would follow them through over time to study emergence of disease conditions or health states that were absent in the beginning of the study. In case control studies, scientists would consider people with and without diseases and would then use data collection to ascertain likelihood of exposure. While these study designs provide insights into individual exposure and outcomes, these study designs are of limited use when it comes to study parameters of climate change, because the variations are in planetary scales or in scales over hundreds and thousands of years. On the other thand, study designs such as ecological study designs where aggregated measuresments are used for comparing exposures and outcomes are preferred to study time dependent or space dependent changes in both exposures and outcomes and such study designs with large scale data ("big data") are also suited to study planetary scale variability. However, while these studies based on aggregated data are useful for studying associations between climate change parameters, they are also not applicable to individual situations. In other words, knowing temperature changes are associated increase mortality or hospitalisations would not enable us to deduce that on a particular hot day or weather conditions would also predict an individual with a higher risk of death or hospitalisation. Such inference is referred to as ecological fallacy and indicates that it is impossible to extrapolate results of ecological studies to individual cases <span>(WHO 2001)</span>. While it is impossible to infer individual causal risk associations from aggregated measurements and therefore from the results of epidemiological studies, scientists have studied the health effects of climate change in other ways. We will provide here examples of how epidemic investigation, and use of metrics where vulnerability of individuals as variation of responses to climate changes can be used to study health effects of climate change. One approach towards attributing climate change as a contributor to health effects is to use epidemiological methods to study health effects and specific environmental exposure that are attributed to climate change. For example, Martinez-Urtaza (2010) conducted a review of the outbreaks of the vibrio parahaemolyticus and vibrio vulnificus in different parts of the world and suggest that data from satellite imagery have provided oceanographic data of the spread of the warmer ocean water to temperate and closer to the poles and El Nino phenomena have contributed to the emergence of virulent strains of vibrio parahaemolyticus and vibrio vulnificus and new epidemics and endemic regions have appeared in regions of the world that were not known previously <span>(Martinez-Urtaza et al. 2010)</span>. This approach provides an indirect connection to the causal linkage between climate change and specific disease or disease outbreaks. In an investigation of gastroenteritis outbreak in a cruise ship in Alaska in 2004, McLaughlin et.al. (2005) conducted a retrospective cohort study of the passengers in the cruise ship where the gastroenteritis outbreak occured and found that consumption of raw oysters was predictor of illness. The investigators suggested that the rising temperature of the ocean water contributed to this outbreak <span>(McLaughlin et al. 2005)</span>. While the investigators conducted a retrospective cohort study to ascertain the cause of the illness in the cruise-ship passengers, the real cause could be traced back to the phenomenon of global warming and climate change as this investigation would reveal that the northernmost documented source of the oysters spread by about 1000 kilometers and this unusual phenomenon might be explained by an unusual warm ocean water.</div><div>According to AR5 report of the IPCC, there are three mechanisms by which cilmate change will exert effects on health: direct impacts of climate change, indirect impacts, and human factor mediated changes. Direct impacts include increased temperature, increased risks of drought and flood, heavy rainfall in places, increased risk of hurricanes and storms; &nbsp;indirect effects include increase in vector species such as mosquitoes, crop failure, and other effects that will result in response to climate related changes; and societal changes, for example, conflicts, migration of people from one region to another&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Smith:2011wj}</cite>. &nbsp;Epidemiological studies have addressed each of these factors on the association with specified health outcomes.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h1>Glossary</h1><h1>References</h1><div><div>Allwood, J M, V Bosetti, N K Dubash, L Gomez-Echeverri, and C von Stechow. 2014. ‚ÄúGlossary.‚Äù In <i>Climate Change 2014:</i> edited by O Edenhofer, R Pichs-Madruga, Y Sokona, E Farahani, K Kadner, and J C Minx, 1‚Äì34.
