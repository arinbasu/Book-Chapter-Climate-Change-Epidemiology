  annote = {In ths paper the authors argue that Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio Vulnificus infections have increased since the 1970s and the geographical regions of the world where they now occur have expanded from where they used ot occur. For VP, the geographical region has expanded from Japan to the US, South America and even Alaska. For Vv, the zones have likewise changed from tropics to the more temperate regions of the world. The reason of such change is attributed to the flow of warm water from the tropics to the more polar regions and also to the phenomenon of El Nino or La Nina where there are reversals of ocean temperature and storm patterns. As a result of this, not only do the surface temperature of the oceans change, the salinity also cahnges as tropical sea water invade the temperate ocean water. This also leads to the loss of native planktons and they are replaced by planktons that are carried by the warm sea water from the tropics. This in turn leads to the breeding ground for VP and VV virulent strains in the seafood and oysters. As the seafood are handled and consumed, this leads to increased emergence of gastrointestinal outbreaks or outbreaks of wound infections leading to primary or secondarysepticemia. These were rare before the 1970s. In 2004, an outbreak of GE due to VP broke out in Alaska. It was found that the outbreak was caused due to consmption of raw oysters that were harvested in warmer ocean water as opposed to their usuall harvesting of colder sea water. Once the harvesting of the oysters in colder sea water was resumed, the disease rates also came down.},
