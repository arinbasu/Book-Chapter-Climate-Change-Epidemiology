<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Abstract</h2><div></div><div>In this chapter, we describe the epidemiological study designs that are used to analyse health effects due to climate change. Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health related states and use of that knowledge to improve population health. Global warming is a key force that has significant impacts on population health. The aim of this chapter is to provide an outline of key epidemiological approaches that are used to study health impacts of climate change. We begin with a brief description of the key issues associated with climate change (increase in the ambient temperature due to global warming, increased and abnormal patterns of rainfall and humidity, glacial melting and rise in the sea levels, and increased frequency of storms and adverse weather events due to possible alterations in the oceanic currents and forces). Climate change brings epidemiological research at the crossroads of studying health effects of heat exposure, natural disasters, emergent infectious diseases, health effects due to migration, and increased human-animal interactions. We next provide a brief overview of key epidemiological study designs and principles to describe and identify determinants to study these phenomena (principles of disease surveillance, longitudinal studies, retrospective and prospective cohort studies, case control studies, and case crossover studies). In the third &amp; final section, we describe the challenges and approaches of different epidemiological study designs and approaches for each of these different situations and sketch out a conceptual map of the next steps in using epidemiological studies to address health issues associated with global warmng.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Introduction: Global Warming &amp; Anthropocene</h2><div>Svante Arrhenius and the theory of warming</div><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Evidence of Global Warming</h2><div>Keeling Curve</div><div>Global Temperature</div><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection"><div>Summary of the geological &amp; environmental Impacts of Global Warming</div><div>Geological impacts of global warming</div><div></div><div>Summary and key features of studies conducted on health impacts of living in the Anthropocene</div><div></div><div>Warming, temperature &amp; heat stress</div><div></div><div>Health effects of cooling</div><div></div><div>Health impacts of mass migration</div><div></div><div>Impacts of disaster and concepts of epidemiological studies of health impacts of natural disasters</div><div></div><div>Epidemiology of emergent infectious diseases</div><div></div><div>A primer on the key principles of epidemiological study designs&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Understanding causal inference &amp; attributable risks</div><div></div><div>Concepts of Chance, Bias, Confounding</div><div></div><div>Hill's Criteria</div><div></div><div>Rothman's Pie and Attributable Risks</div><div></div><div>Principles of disease surveillance</div><div></div><div>Principles of designing longitudinal and time series analysis for assessing environmental health impacts</div><div></div><div>Ecological study designs such as time series and spatial epidemiological studies</div><div></div><div>Retrospective and prop</div></h2><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Design and principles of interpretation of &nbsp;case control, and case crossover studies</h2><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Challenges and opportunities for conducting Epidemiological studies on health impact of climate change</h2><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">References</h2><div></div><div>Glossary</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>What do we know about the health effects of Global Warming</div>
