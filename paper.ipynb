    "The idea is to write a scholarly paper in Jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebooks are great for writing free texts, paragraphs, markdown lists, characters, footnotes to particular chunks. You can conduct data analyses, add graphics, move aroundt texts and everything renders nicely in html. You can also convert a notebook to latex for publication, or html using the ``nbconvert`` command. So things work well with this tool. We are going to explore if we can do the following three things:\n",
